## Introduction

**RLSolver: GPU-based Massively Parallel Environments for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization (CO) Problems Using Reinforcement Learning**

RLSolver aims to showcase the effectiveness of GPU-based massively parallel environments for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with reinforcement learning (RL). With thousands of CUDA cores and tensor cores, the sampling speed is improved by 2–3 orders of magnitude over traditional CPU-based environments, which significantly enhances convergence speed and solution quality.

RLSolver consists of three key components:
- **Environments**: GPU-based massively parallel simulation for CO problems.
- **Agents**: RL solvers like REINFORCE, DQN, etc.
- **Problems**: Graph Max-Cut, Ising Model, and more.

We design **two tasks** to promote GPU-powered RL optimization:
1. **Graph Max-Cut with Parallel RL Agents**
2. **Ising Model Ground-State Estimation via MCMC-based RL**

We welcome researchers, students, and practitioners from optimization, RL, or GPU computing communities to participate!


## Tasks

Each team can choose to participate in one or both tasks. Awards and recognitions will be given for each task.

### Task I: Graph Max-Cut

Develop reinforcement learning agents to solve Max-Cut problems on large graphs. Agents must be trained in a **distribution-wise** fashion across families of graphs, utilizing GPU-based environments for sampling.

#### Dataset

Synthetic graphs generated from the following distributions:
- **BA (Barabási–Albert)**
- **ER (Erdős–Rényi)**
- **PL (Power-Law)**

Each graph file follows:

```
n m           # number of nodes and edges  
u v w         # edge from node u to v with weight w  
```

#### Goal

Maximize the cut value using RL agents with batched training environments.

---

### Task II: Ising Model

Train RL agents to find low-energy states of 2D Ising models using GPU-accelerated MCMC or spin-flip environments. The environment simulates spin lattices with interaction energy, and agents learn policies to flip spins efficiently.

#### Dataset

Generated 2D Ising model grids of various sizes (e.g., 16×16, 32×32). Participants may use or extend the provided PyTorch/CUDA simulator for custom training.

#### Goal

Minimize the total system energy across random initial configurations.
