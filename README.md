## Overview

**RLSolver** explores the effectiveness of GPU-based massively parallel environments for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems using reinforcement learning (RL). With thousands of CUDA and tensor cores, sampling speed is improved by 2â€“3 orders of magnitude over CPU-based methods.

It features three main components:
- **Environments**: GPU-based simulation for CO problems
- **Agents**: RL algorithms like REINFORCE, DQN, PPO, etc.
- **Problems**: Graph Max-Cut, Ising Model, and more

We host two tasks to encourage cross-disciplinary solutions across RL, optimization, and high-performance computing.

## Task 1: Graph Max-Cut with Parallel RL Agents

Develop GPU-accelerated RL agents to solve the Max-Cut problem on large graphs. This task focuses on learning generalizable solutions across different graph distributions (e.g., BA, ER, PL).  
Starter kit coming soon.

## Task 2: Ising Ground-State Estimation via RL-MCMC

Estimate the ground state of Ising models using a reinforcement learning agent enhanced by MCMC sampling techniques.  
Starter kit coming soon.

## Call for Papers: Special Track on RL for CO

We invite submissions to our **Special Track: Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization**, which welcomes original research that applies RL to CO problems. Topics include (but are not limited to):
- Graph Max-Cut, Knapsack, ILP, and Number Partitioning
- Ising models, quantum circuit search
- Vehicle Routing, UAV Path Planning, Ridesharing
- Supply Chain Management (SCM): production, inventory, logistics
- Emerging trends in Quantum AI and generative RL

The special track is designed to foster collaboration between the optimization, machine learning, and GPU computing communities.
